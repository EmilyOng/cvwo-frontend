# frontend

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- `yarn lint`: Performs code linting

### Setting up your environment

- (In `.env.production`) `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL`: https://tusk-manager-backend.herokuapp.com/api
- (In `.env.development`): `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL`: http://localhost:8080/api

### Directory Structure

Components in the application are organised according to:

- atoms
- molecules
- organisms
- pages

This follows the atomic web design principle as written in this [blog article](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
